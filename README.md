   ### Hello everyone,

Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience in Business Intelligence environments, specializing in Tableau and SQL-based data modeling.

I design and maintain executive dashboards, translate business requirements into analytical solutions, and support decision-making through structured, reliable data systems.

In addition, I work as a QA specialist for AI-driven legacy code modernization systems, validating generated outputs, testing application behavior, and ensuring business rules integrity in production environments.

With a background in Software Engineering, I bring a systems-oriented mindset to data analytics — focusing not only on visualization, but on data architecture, performance, and reliability.
